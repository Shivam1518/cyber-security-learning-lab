# SIEM Log Sources

Log sources are the backbone of SIEM.  
A SIEM is only as good as the logs it ingests.

Without correct log sources → no visibility → no detection → no incident response.

# 🔹 Categories of Log Sources

## 1. **Endpoint Logs**
Collected from:
- Windows Event Viewer  
- Linux Syslog  
- MacOS logs  
- EDR agents  

### Common Windows Logs:
| Event ID | Meaning |
|---------|----------|
| 4624 | Successful login |
| 4625 | Failed login |
| 4688 | Process creation |
| 1102 | Audit logs cleared |
| 4720 | User account created |
| 4728 | Added to admin group |

### Common Linux Logs:
- `/var/log/auth.log`  
- `/var/log/syslog`  
- SSH logs  
- Sudo attempts  
- Cron jobs  

---

## 2. **Network Logs**
Generated by:
- Firewalls  
- Routers  
- Switches  
- IDS/IPS  
- VPN gateways  

### Examples:
- Allowed/blocked connections  
- Port scanning  
- Suspicious outbound traffic  
- Unauthorized internal movement (east-west traffic)  

---

## 3. **Application Logs**
Collected from:
- Web servers (Apache, Nginx, IIS)  
- Databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL)  
- Authentication apps (AD, Okta)  
- Business applications  

### Examples:
- Login failures  
- Unexpected API calls  
- SQL errors  
- File upload attempts  

---

## 4. **Cloud Logs**
From:
- AWS CloudTrail  
- Azure Activity Logs  
- GCP Audit Logs  
- Cloud security tools  

### Examples:
- Console logins  
- Role changes  
- IAM misconfigurations  
- S3 bucket access  
- Serverless activity (Lambda, Functions)  

---

## 5. **Security Tools Logs**
From tools like:
- EDR  
- WAF  
- Antivirus  
- DLP  
- Honeypots  

These provide **enriched, security-focused telemetry**.

---

## 6. **Threat Intelligence Logs**
Includes:
- Malicious IPs  
- Hashes  
- Domains  
- URLs  
- C2 servers  
- IOC feeds  

Used for IOC-based correlation.

# 🔹 Why Log Sources Matter
Every SIEM rule starts with log data:

Example:

> No process creation logs (4688) = No detection for malware execution.  
> No network logs = No port scan detection.  
> No cloud logs = No unauthorized IAM detection.  

Without logs → your SIEM is blind.

# 🔹 Minimum Required Log Sources (Industry Standard)

### For Enterprise:
- Windows Security Logs  
- Linux Syslog  
- Firewall logs  
- VPN logs  
- WAF logs  
- EDR logs  
- DHCP / DNS logs  
- CloudTrail (if cloud usage exists)

### For SOC:
- SIEM data  
- Threat Intelligence  
- Network telemetry

# 🔹 At Seceon (for you)
The most important logs:
- Windows Events  
- Linux Syslog  
- Firewalls  
- WAF  
- EDR  
- Cloud (if clients use AWS/Azure)  

These feed directly into aiSIEM’s correlation engine.
